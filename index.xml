      <title>pekwm theme scaling</title>

      <description>Got the question if pekwm supported HiDPI display, or theme scaling more specifically, and as it did not I got excited about it and started implementing theme scaling for pekwm and its shipped tools.
A single scaling setting in the Screen section controls the scaling:
Screen { Scale = &amp;#34;2.0&amp;#34; } If the factor is an integer, pixels are scaled to 4, 9, 16 etc pixels without any scaling artifacts. It is possible to specify 1.</description>

      <title>pekwm daytime</title>

      <description>Most (desktop) environments these days have support for both a light and dark mode and during the winter semester the changes in ambient lighting is quite dramatic during the day and so this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to have in pekwm not having to do it manually.
During the summer semester, there&amp;rsquo;s virtually no need for me as it is mostly bright outside during the hours I&amp;rsquo;m awake.
Anyway, pekwm has gotten a new optional component, pekwm_sys that is configured in the new Sys section of the main config file.</description>

      <title>pekwm-0.3.1 released</title>

      <guid>https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/pekwm_0.3.1_released/</guid>
      <description>First maintenance release in the new 0.3.X series of pekwm releases.
Closed issues pekwm #170, Reduce flickering when placing new windows. #175, GotoItem N now skips separators and non-visible items. #163, ButtonRelase actions on the Client working again. #161, GotoItem N regression caused it to behave as NextItem. Use X double buffer extension in pekwm_panel and pekwm_dialog to avoid flickering on redraws. X11 font name detection would fail if any font options was specified, such as alignment.</description>

      <description>pekwm-0.3.0 has been released and includes quite a bit of changes compared to the previous pekwm-0.2.1 not to speak of whats still in some distributions that being pekwm-0.1.18.
These releases got me thinking about the impact the release frequency has on software.
First, lets start of with the not so impressive pekwm release history:
0.3.0, 2022-01, 13 month since 0.2.1. 0.2.1, 2021-12, 1 month since 0.2.0. 0.2.0, 2021-10, 11 months since 0.</description>

      <title>pekwm and pywal</title>
      <link>https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/pekwm_pywal/</link>

      <description>A friend of mine asked me if it was possible to use pywal together with pekwm a while back.
pywal is a tool that generates a color scheme from the dominant colors in an image. Amongst other things, the color scheme is set in Xresources.
Me, being unaware of what pywal was at that time, looked into it and figured a good way of supporting it would be to allow for pekwm to read color information from Xresources.</description>

      <description>After I was given a Sun Blade 1500, I started working on getting it setup trying to see if I could use it as a development machine.
To get software I want compiled I started pkgsrc as there aren&amp;rsquo;t many alternatives other than Ravenports and building everything by hand.
I also got myself (a now dead) Sun Ultra 40 reducing wait times while trying to get software compiled, even though it was x86_64 most compatability issues are unrelated to the architecture.</description>

      <title>Sun Blade 1500 on Solaris 10</title>

      <description>A while back I was fortunate enough to be given a Sun Blade 1500 from a long time pekwm user.
It is, by todays standards, old and slow making it perfect for experiencing how pekwm actually performs. Also, running Solaris 10, being big endian and using Xsun instead of a current Xorg server makes it perfect to find odd issues.
I had a few issues with getting machine up and running, the PSU and harddrive experienced some post storage issues.</description>

      <title>Compile times, GCC 4.8</title>
      <link>https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/compile_times-gcc-4.8/</link>

      <guid>https://pekdon.pekwm.se/posts/compile_times-gcc-4.8/</guid>
      <description>My main development machine at the moment is a ~7 year old Lenovo T440s laptop which is more than snappy enough for my needs but it is starting to show its age when it comes to some of the more javascript intensive web sites and when compiling software.
Moving from OpenBSD to FreeBSD trying the 13 BETA out I noticed that GCC-4.8 was available. Given that GCC 4.8 being the first GCC release stating support for most major features of C++11 I thought it was worth giving it a go to see how the compile times compare with the system compiler, clang 11.</description>

      <title>pekwm_panel in the works!</title>

      <description>After rebooting the pekwm development, the activity from users on Github page has increased and in one of the recent issues a comment was added noting that it was hard to know iconified windows exist.
The seasoned users know of the Icon menu, however, as a new pekwm user it is less than obvious how one should know the iconfied windows exist. As it was noted this was not a problem in other environments where a panel is available listing all clients I decided to create a pekwm_panel.</description>

      <description>As part of getting pekwm back on track the infrastructure for a theme index has started to take shape with the following components:
pekwm-theme-index, a repository on GitHub with a collection of theme files containing meta-data about themes. pekwm-theme-page, the page and screenshot generator for https://www.pekwm.se/themes/ based on the data from pekwm-theme-index. pekwm_theme, shell script included with pekwm for managing user themes. This post focus on the last component in the list above, the user command for managing themes.</description>

      <description>The pekwm development has been non-existent the last couple of years and before that it has been very slow for many years. Many reasons behind this including but not limited to not using a Linux machine at work, life has been busy and a lack of interest.
My interest has come back, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten myself an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Lenovo T440S running OpenBSD at home and started working on pekwm again.
To be able to spend more time on actual development and not maintain infrastructure and what-not there has been some changes:</description>
