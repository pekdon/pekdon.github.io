    <p><p>Using neovim on older systems the performance hit it comes with compared to vim
is noticeable so I tend to use vim. This comes with a number of drawbacks, one
of them being that a lot of current themes are for neovim only, and in lua
format at that.</p>
<p>To work around this I created a simple script to generate a <code>.vim</code> file out
of a lua theme directory.</p>
<p>Want to try it out? These are the steps:</p></p>

    <p><p>Got the question if pekwm supported HiDPI display, or theme scaling more
specifically, and as it did not I got excited about it and started
implementing theme scaling for pekwm and its shipped tools.</p>
<p>A single scaling setting in the <code>Screen</code> section controls the scaling:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Screen {
    Scale = &#34;2.0&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>If the factor is an integer, pixels are scaled to 4, 9, 16 etc pixels
without any scaling artifacts. It is possible to specify 1.5 but scaling
result will not be as clean.</p></p>

    <p><p>Most (desktop) environments these days have support for both a light and dark
mode and during the winter semester the changes in ambient lighting is quite
dramatic during the day and so this is something I&rsquo;ve been wanting to have in
pekwm not having to do it manually.</p>
<p>During the summer semester, there&rsquo;s virtually no need for me as it is mostly
bright outside during the hours I&rsquo;m awake.</p>
<p>Anyway, pekwm has gotten a new optional component, pekwm_sys that is
configured in the new <code>Sys</code> section of the main config file.</p></p>

    <p><p><a href="https://github.com/pekwm/pekwm/releases/tag/release-0.3.0">pekwm-0.3.0</a> has
been released and includes quite a bit of changes compared to the previous
<a href="https://github.com/pekwm/pekwm/releases/tag/release-0.2.1">pekwm-0.2.1</a> not
to speak of whats still in some distributions that being
<a href="https://github.com/pekwm/pekwm/releases/tag/release-0.1.18">pekwm-0.1.18</a>.</p>
<p>These releases got me thinking about the impact the release frequency has on software.</p>
<p>First, lets start of with the not so impressive pekwm release history:</p>
<ul>
<li>0.3.0, 2022-01, 13 month since 0.2.1.</li>
<li>0.2.1, 2021-12, 1 month since 0.2.0.</li>
<li>0.2.0, 2021-10, 11 months since 0.1.18.</li>
<li>0.1.18, 2020-11, 90 months since 0.1.17.</li>
<li>0.1.17, 2013-05, 6 months since 0.1.16.</li>
<li>0.1.16, 2012-11, 3 months since 0.1.15.</li>
<li>0.1.15, 2012-08, 8 months since 0.1.14.</li>
<li>0.1.14, 2011-12, 6 months since 0.1.13.</li>
<li>0.1.13, 2011-06, 14 months since 0.1.12.</li>
<li>0.1.12, 2010-03, 10 months since 0.1.11.</li>
<li>0.1.11, 2009-05, 4 months since 0.1.10.</li>
<li>0.1.10, 2009-01, 1 month since 0.1.9.</li>
<li>0.1.9, 2008-12, 2 months since 0.1.8.</li>
<li>0.1.8, 2008-10, 2 months since 0.1.7.</li>
<li>0.1.7, 2008-08, 15 months since 0.1.6.</li>
<li>0.1.6, 2007-05, 13 months since 0.1.5.</li>
<li>0.1.5, 2006-04, 2 months since 0.1.4.</li>
<li>0.1.4, 2006-02, 32 months since 0.1.3.</li>
<li>0.1.3, 2003-06, 8 months since 0.1.2.</li>
<li>0.1.2, 2002-10, 4 days since 0.1.1.</li>
<li>0.1.1, 2002-10, second pekwm release.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the above list shows, the release frequency have been quite irregular to
say the least and having releases drag behind have caused a lot of users
having to run the development version for a smooth experience.</p></p>

<a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal">pywal</a> together with pekwm a while back.</p>
<p>pywal is a tool that generates a color scheme from the dominant colors in
an image. Amongst other things, the color scheme is set in Xresources.</p>
<p>Me, being unaware of what pywal was at that time, looked into it and figured
a good way of supporting it would be to allow for pekwm to read color
information from Xresources.</p></p>

<p>It is, by todays standards, old and slow making it perfect for experiencing
how pekwm actually performs. Also, running Solaris 10, being big endian and
using Xsun instead of a current Xorg server makes it perfect to find odd
issues.</p>
<p>I had a few issues with getting machine up and running, the PSU and harddrive
experienced some post storage issues. The PSU magically got back to life after
trying another PSU out, harddrive got replaced. When that was all sorted out
trying pekwm out to see if there was any issues.</p></p>

T440s laptop which is more than snappy enough for my needs but it is
starting to show its age when it comes to some of the more javascript

<p>Moving from OpenBSD to FreeBSD trying the 13 BETA out I noticed that
GCC-4.8 was available. Given that GCC 4.8 being the first GCC release
stating support for most major features of C++11 I thought it was
worth giving it a go to see how the compile times compare with the
system compiler, clang 11.</p></p>
