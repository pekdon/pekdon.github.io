      <description>After rebooting the pekwm development, the activity from users on Github page has increased and in one of the recent issues a comment was added noting that it was hard to know iconified windows exist.
The seasoned users know of the Icon menu, however, as a new pekwm user it is less than obvious how one should know the iconfied windows exist. As it was noted this was not a problem in other environments where a panel is available listing all clients I decided to create a pekwm_panel.</description>

      <description>As part of getting pekwm back on track the infrastructure for a theme index has started to take shape with the following components:
 pekwm-theme-index, a repository on GitHub with a collection of theme files containing meta-data about themes. pekwm-theme-page, the page and screenshot generator for https://www.pekwm.se/themes/ based on the data from pekwm-theme-index. pekwm_theme, shell script included with pekwm for managing user themes.  This post focus on the last component in the list above, the user command for managing themes.</description>

My interest has come back, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten myself an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Lenovo T440S running OpenBSD at home and started working on pekwm again.
To be able to spend more time on actual development and not maintain infrastructure and what-not there has been some changes:</description>
