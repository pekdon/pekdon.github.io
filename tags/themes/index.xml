      <description>Got the question if pekwm supported HiDPI display, or theme scaling more specifically, and as it did not I got excited about it and started implementing theme scaling for pekwm and its shipped tools.
A single scaling setting in the Screen section controls the scaling:
Screen { Scale = &amp;#34;2.0&amp;#34; } If the factor is an integer, pixels are scaled to 4, 9, 16 etc pixels without any scaling artifacts. It is possible to specify 1.</description>

      <title>pekwm daytime</title>

      <description>Most (desktop) environments these days have support for both a light and dark mode and during the winter semester the changes in ambient lighting is quite dramatic during the day and so this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to have in pekwm not having to do it manually.
During the summer semester, there&amp;rsquo;s virtually no need for me as it is mostly bright outside during the hours I&amp;rsquo;m awake.
Anyway, pekwm has gotten a new optional component, pekwm_sys that is configured in the new Sys section of the main config file.</description>

      <title>pekwm and pywal</title>

      <description>A friend of mine asked me if it was possible to use pywal together with pekwm a while back.
pywal is a tool that generates a color scheme from the dominant colors in an image. Amongst other things, the color scheme is set in Xresources.
Me, being unaware of what pywal was at that time, looked into it and figured a good way of supporting it would be to allow for pekwm to read color information from Xresources.</description>
