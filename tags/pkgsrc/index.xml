      <description>After I was given a Sun Blade 1500, I started working on getting it setup trying to see if I could use it as a development machine.
To get software I want compiled I started pkgsrc as there aren&amp;rsquo;t many alternatives other than Ravenports and building everything by hand.
I also got myself (a now dead) Sun Ultra 40 reducing wait times while trying to get software compiled, even though it was x86_64 most compatability issues are unrelated to the architecture.</description>
