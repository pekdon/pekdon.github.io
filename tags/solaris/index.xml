      <description>After I was given a Sun Blade 1500, I started working on getting it setup trying to see if I could use it as a development machine.
To get software I want compiled I started pkgsrc as there aren&amp;rsquo;t many alternatives other than Ravenports and building everything by hand.
I also got myself (a now dead) Sun Ultra 40 reducing wait times while trying to get software compiled, even though it was x86_64 most compatability issues are unrelated to the architecture.</description>

      <description>A while back I was fortunate enough to be given a Sun Blade 1500 from a long time pekwm user.
It is, by todays standards, old and slow making it perfect for experiencing how pekwm actually performs. Also, running Solaris 10, being big endian and using Xsun instead of a current Xorg server makes it perfect to find odd issues.
I had a few issues with getting machine up and running, the PSU and harddrive experienced some post storage issues.</description>
